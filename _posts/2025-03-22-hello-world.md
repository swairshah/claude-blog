# Hello World!

This is my first blog post using the markdown-to-HTML conversion system. Markdown makes it easy to write blog posts with formatting like:

## Features

- **Bold text** for emphasis
- *Italic text* for subtle emphasis
- Lists like this one
- [Links](https://github.com)
- Code blocks

```javascript
console.log('Hello, world!');
```

## Why Markdown?

Markdown is perfect for blogging because:

1. It's simple to learn
2. It converts easily to HTML
3. It focuses on content rather than formatting
4. It's widely supported

> Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, 
> which then converts to structurally valid HTML.

I'm excited to share more posts soon!
