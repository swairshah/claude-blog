# uvloop's Superior Resource Management: Solving Asyncio's Event Loop Closure Issues

Python's asyncio library provides powerful asynchronous programming capabilities but can sometimes produce unexpected errors during program execution. This article examines a common asyncio issue - the "RuntimeError: Event loop is closed" exception - and demonstrates how uvloop's advanced resource management capabilities resolve this problem efficiently.

## Problem Description

When building a terminal script using Pydantic AI's `Agent` and `MCPServerStdio` to handle subprocesses asynchronously, the following error occurred after successful program execution:

```
Exception ignored in: <coroutine object BaseSubprocessTransport.__del__ at 0x7fc930e5da40>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/path/to/python3.10/asyncio/base_subprocess.py", line 126, in __del__
    self.close()
  File "/path/to/python3.10/asyncio/unix_events.py", line 547, in close
    self._close(None)
  File "/path/to/python3.10/asyncio/base_events.py", line 753, in call_soon
    self._check_closed()
  File "/path/to/python3.10/asyncio/base_events.py", line 515, in _check_closed
    raise RuntimeError('Event loop is closed')
RuntimeError: Event loop is closed
```

The initial code implementation was:

```python
import asyncio
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.mcp import MCPServerStdio
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel

async def main():
    model = OpenAIModel("gpt-4o-mini")
    fs_server = MCPServerStdio('npx', ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", os.getcwd()])
    git_server = MCPServerStdio("uv", ["--directory", os.getcwd(), "run", "mcp-server-git"])
    agent = Agent(model, mcp_servers=[fs_server, git_server])

    async with agent.run_mcp_servers():
        result = await agent.run("whats the most recent commit in current git repository")
        print(result.data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Root Cause Analysis

This error occurs due to asyncio's resource management approach. When using `asyncio.run()`:

1. The function creates and manages an event loop
2. After the main coroutine completes, the event loop is closed
3. Subprocess objects created during execution are left to Python's garbage collector
4. During garbage collection, these objects attempt to schedule callbacks on the now-closed event loop
5. This triggers the RuntimeError exception

## Solution Implementation: uvloop

The most effective solution is implementing uvloop, a drop-in replacement for asyncio's event loop that uses the libuv C library (the same engine powering Node.js).

Adding these two lines resolves the issue:

```python
import uvloop
asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(uvloop.EventLoopPolicy())
```

## Why uvloop Resolves the Issue

uvloop provides several advantages over the standard asyncio implementation:

| Feature | Built-in asyncio | uvloop |
|---------|------------------|--------|
| Implementation | Pure Python | Cython + C (libuv) |
| Subprocess cleanup | Deferred to Python GC | Immediate, proactive |
| Resource management | Less aggressive | More deterministic |
| Performance | Standard | Significantly faster |

uvloop proactively manages subprocess resources and handles cleanup more efficiently, preventing the race condition between event loop closure and resource cleanup that causes the error.

## Alternative Solutions

If uvloop cannot be implemented, these alternative approaches can mitigate the issue:

1. Explicitly close and await termination of subprocesses
2. Add a small delay at the end of the main coroutine:
   ```python
   async def main():
       # existing code
       await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # Allow time for cleanup
   ```

## Technical Recommendations

Based on this analysis:

1. Consider uvloop as a standard component for asyncio-based applications
2. Implement proper resource management for asyncio subprocesses
3. Be aware of the timing between event loop closure and resource cleanup
4. Monitor garbage collection behavior in asyncio applications

These practices will help prevent similar issues in future asyncio implementations and improve overall application stability.
